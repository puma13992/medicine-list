# Personal Medication List Programme

This programme is intended to view a sample medication list. 
This programme came into being because there are still paper lists for medication intake in Germany, 
which are often not up to date or going to lose. The programme is intended to remedy this situation 
and make it possible to make timely entries both on the patient's side and on the doctor's side 
and to make the digital list accessible to emergency services in case of an emergency.

## How to use
As an example, the patient ID you can use  the ID '123456'. 
Otherwise, the programme creates a new patient ID, if you want it.
You can create a new medication list, view and manage your existing list. 
You can update medications or add new medications.
It`s not possible to delete medications; you can only set a 'Stop Date' on it.
This is important to keep an overview of all medications (current AND past) for your (potential) doctors.
